# GiorgioByMoroder

This is my first application I developed to learn SwiftUI. I created a fun application using some animations, Drag Gesture, custom button view and AVAudioPlayer. When you drag the button, you can switch to the second screen and listen to a section of the Daft Punk's Giorgio by Moroder :)
